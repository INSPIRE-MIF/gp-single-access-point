This repository contains a techncal approach (Good Practice) for building one access point to dispersed data sources. It is published in the form of [the guidelines](https://github.com/marty1357/gp-single-access-point/blob/main/gp-single-access-point.md) document containing the metodology of integrating local WMS services in one end-point, significantly lowering Spatial Data Infrastructure's complexity from the end-user perspective.

Development of the guidelines is a follow-up to [INSPIRE Good Practice proposal](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/good-practice/building-one-access-point-dispersed-data-sources) development.
