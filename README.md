This repository contains a techncal approach (Good Practice) for building one access point to dispersed data sources. It is published in the form of the [guidelines](https://github.com/marty1357/gp-single-access-point/blob/main/gp-single-access-point.md) document allowing organisations to integrate local WMS services in one end-point, significantly lowering Spatial Data Infrastructure's complexity from the end-user perspective.
